Destructor:- (opposite of constructor)
Destructor = special function that runs automatically when an object is destroyed.

Its job:
👉 free memory / Deallocate
👉 clean resources

Properties:-
• same name as class
• ~ before name
• no return type
• no parameters

One-line rule - 
❗ new → delete
❗ constructor → destructor

One-line rule (non-negotiable)
❗ If your class uses new
❗ You MUST write a destructor

......................................

Why we use a destructor ?
Because memory/resources you allocate do NOT free themselves.
If you don’t free them → memory leak.

In the code, THIS is the reason
marks = new int(marks);
new takes memory from heap.
Heap memory:
❌ does NOT auto-delete
❌ survives after object ends
So you must release it.

Without destructor:
variable's memory is still alive
program lost its address
leak forever
